# Updating Protect4S TD

To be protected against latest threats, it is important to have your Protect4S Threat Detection solution updated periodically to the latest support package. This can be done via the regular SAP transaction SPAM in client 000.

The latest Protect4S TD Support Package can be obtained via [https://protect4s.com/login](https://protect4s.com/login) with your personal user-ID. If you don't have one please [contact](../support/) our support team.

Keep in mind that the Protect4S TD Support Packages are non-cumulative, so you **just need the latest Support Package** as it contains all previous functionality as well. Support packages for Protect4S TD can only be installed only after the initial Protect4S TD package is installed.

_**Important**: After having imported the latest Support Package make sure to run the Post-Installation wizard via transaction_ **/n/TDWO/PI** in the productive client you use Protect4S TD in.
