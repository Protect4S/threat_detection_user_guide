# Certificate issues

In case of certificate issues and errors like SSSLERR\_PEER\_CERT\_UNTRUSTED or SSSLERR\_SERVER\_CERT\_MISMATCH in the ICM log, make sure to import the needed certificates in transaction STRUST. See [this chapter](../../../application-setup/troubleshooting/siem-certificates.md) for details.
