# Place in landscape

Protect4S Threat Detection is delivered as a removable SAP Add-On. The solution runs in a central place in the SAP landscape and serves as a hub to gather events from other SAP systems in the landscape. The solution performs threat intelligence on these events and forwards detected threats in the SAP landscape to a connected SIEM solution.
