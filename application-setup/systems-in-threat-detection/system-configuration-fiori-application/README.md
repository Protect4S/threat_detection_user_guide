In order to monitor the events, it is mandatory to add systems in the Threat Detection solution.\
For this activity, you will need the technical configurator or the administrator role to proceed.

Threat Detection Solution uses its own System ID which is numeric. Which is the same way used in our other Solution "_Protect4S - Vulnerability Management_".

The System ID is an unique number and belongs to the set of System configured in Threat Detection. During any analysis and investigation you will need this System ID to know from which system the event or threat is triggered from.

This should not be confused with SAP SID. With this, you can add the same system that has already been added in Threat Detection again depending on your needs.

Once opened you will see the following screen below.

This list should be empty if this is your first time using this solution or you haven't added any systems yet.

In this overview, we can see the SAP SID, System role, business relevance and System ID. The description field can be used as an indicator to get more details for the person that will be handling the events.
