To limit false positives, it is important to configure the allow / deny policies specifically according to your situation. No SAP landscape is similar and use cases need some tweaking and tuning in order to be effective, to limit false positives and add specific data for your situation. All fields are wildcard-enabled and you can use the SAP standard escape characters (like #, + and \*), see note  [574914](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/574914) for details. Below overview lists the attributes for the allow / deny policies:

| Wildcard Enabled | <p>Indicates whether the wildcard symbol (asterisk) can be used or will be seen as a wildcard. <br>Note, if the policy is related to users, where the username starts with SAP, do not use wildcard, but enter the user(s) manually. This is because of the existence of the emergency user that exist in the system (SAP*). In general you would not want anyone to misuse the emergency user SAP* to perform anything.</p> |
