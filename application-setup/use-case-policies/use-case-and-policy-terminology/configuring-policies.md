# !Configuring policies

### Starting off by adjusting policies

The Use Case policies can be configured to avoid false-positives but also add more customer specific checks of the Threats in a SAP landscape. No SAP landscape is the same and customers have specific naming conventions for users, specific configurations and setup of the landscape. Via the policies you can finetune and drill down the specific checks.

After installation of Protect4S TD it is therefore important to tune the policies to reflect your specific situation. For each use case there are [recommendations](../../recommendations/) for finetuning,&#x20;

Any Use Case policy change requires you to first make a copy to your own version.

The policies shipped by us cannot be deleted, should you however find a check unnecessary or unfit for your situation, you can deactivate it. This is also done in your own policy version as it is prioritized higher

### Configuring policies

The policies are indicated with colors, fields with green background means exceptions that can be given greenlight, Whereas Red means that these Threats triggers are the triggers in the respective Use Case.&#x20;

Only Use Cases with Threat values have an additional field Named Threat, that have a red background color indicating that the Use Case checks these values.

Additional Threat Values can be added for example Z table or Z report.

To configure new policies, a few examples are shown below:

#### Use Case with no known Threat Value

For use case S-000170-01 (User creation outside IAM\_CUA).&#x20;

Whether you company makes use of CUA, IAM, or neither, you will want to avoid false positives being reported. Add the users permitted for this activity in the policy list.

The policy can be used to add users to the exception list to avoid false positives. In the case of this particular use case, users that are allowed to create users, e.g. via Central User Administration or IDM solutions can be added here. Often customers use a fixed username(s) for these kind of systems that is used also in RFC connections for example. This use case detects any users that are creating users, adding users to the policy exempts them.&#x20;

To configure, the first step is to duplicate the Use Case Policy to your own version. Any non standard policy is appears as: '**Default: No**'.

Below you can see an example where values are already defined for CUAADM and any user that starts with GRC because a wildcard is used at the end.&#x20;

Notice be cautions when you are using wildcard.

If you enter the policy in edit mode, you can change or add values of the policy, in our example, we have changed the value "CUAADM" to "CUAADMINISTRATOR".

To add values in the policy, while in edit mode; click on the Create button. A new line will appear where you can enter the value you wish to add.

Click on Save to commit your changes at the lower right corner. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

To remove a policy value, simply enter edit mode, select the rule you wish to remove and click on delete. The below screenshot we will remove the rule we just created.

To finalize, click on Save to commit your changes at the lower right corner. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

Should you want to keep the policy and only want to temporary turn off, click the checkbox of the deactivate to deactivate without deleting. Additionally you can use the comment field to explain why it was deactivated.

#### Use Case with known Threat Value

Use cases with known threat value have a column named "Threat Value". This column has a red background color for easier indication.

#### Handling of multiple same Threat Value

If there are duplicate Threat value, the flow of handling will be an AND situation.

See picture below which illustrates it:
