# Use Case Policy scope

â€‹When opening the Use Case Policy application, the following screen shows the available use case policies:

When selecting a specific policy you can see the details such as the scope, description and several other attributes of the policy.

### Hierarchy of the scope

Each use case policy can be tailered to your own needs. This can also be done via the scope. By duplicating the default use case policy (since the default delivered policy is not editable) and setting the scope you can define a subset of Threat values and exceptions only applicable for that scope. The following is an overview of the different scopes and hierarchy they have:

| Rank | Scope         |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 1    | Single System |
| 2    | System group  |
| 3    | System role   |
| 4    | All Systems   |

* Select **Single System** to only change the use case policy specifically for one system.&#x20;
* Select **Systems group** to change the use case policy for all systems in this group.
* Select **System Role** to change the use case policy for any system with a specific role, like e.g. only Productive systems.
* Select **All systems** to change the use case policy for all systems configured in the Threat Detection solution
