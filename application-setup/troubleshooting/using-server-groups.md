# Using Server Groups

To enable parallel processing and avoid overloading the Protect4S TD central system, it is possible to configure a Server Group using transaction RZ12.



Create a Logon Group in transaction RZ12 by pressing the button "Create assignment" and supply a name ("Protect4S"). Assign the needed resources to this Logon Group for one or more instances,  make sure to leave some free work-processes for other activities in the system.

In the Protect4S TD Application Settings you can then select this server group.
