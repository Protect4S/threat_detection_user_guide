# SIEM Certificates

If the errors _SSSLERR\_PEER\_CERT\_UNTRUSTED_ or _SSSLERR\_SERVER\_CERT\_MISMATCH_ or other certificate related errors occur in the ICM log this is in most cases because the certificates of the SIEM solution or proxy (like Zscaler) are not trusted / not imported in transaction STRUST in the central system running Protect4S TD. Errors may look like below:

To solve this please follow the below steps:

**Get the certificate(s) from the SIEM solution by** [**downloading**](https://support.shift4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038747254-Export-an-Existing-Certificate-from-a-Web-Browser) **them for example from the browser. Yoh can use the URL from the ICM log and paste that in the browser.**

1. Use your Internet browser to connect to the URL from the ICM log 'https://...'
2. As soon as the connection has been established, display the security details (usually, by double clicking the lock symbol)
3. Display the certificate of the server
4. Export the server certificate into a file (for example, in the format 'Base64')
5. If necessary, open the certificate or the certificates of the certificate chain from the certificate hierarchy, and also export this certificate or these certificates. For example for MS Sentinel there are 3 certificates needed:

**Import the certificates in STRUST**

1. In the Protect4S TD central system call transaction _STRUST_ and double-click on _SSL client (Standard)_ in the left tree view of PSEs (also called "SAPSSLC.pse")
2. From Menu, choose _Certificate->Import_. In the _File_ tab enter the filename of the downloaded cert into the field _File path_, or use the selection help at the end of that field for an Open File popup window of the OS
3. When the proper certificate appears in the certificate details view in the lower right area of transaction _STRUST_, press the _Add to Certificate List_ button on the bottom.
4. Save the changes to the PSE with _Save_ button
5. Optionally you might need to **** Redo steps 1-4 for _SSL client (Anonymous)_ PSE (also called "SAPSSLA.pse")

Newer Releases of SAP Netweaver (702 and 710+) will automatically reload the SSL PSE after saving the change. If the error PEER\_CERT\_UNTRUSTED persists, please try manually restarting the icman process. For old Netweaver Releases (6xx, 700 and 701) you will always have to manually restart the icman process for the PSE change to take effect. Use transaction SMICM, and from Menu "Administration"->"ICM"->"Exit Soft"->"Global" to manually restart the icman process.
