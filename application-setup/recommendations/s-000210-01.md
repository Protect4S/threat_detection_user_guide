# S-000210-01

#### Description

This use case detects lateral movement through RFC hopping. This makes it possible to jump from one SAP system to another in the context of the dialog user in an RFC connection.

#### Configuration

Use this policy to create exceptions for users that are allowed to use the "Remote Logon" functionality in transaction SM59 to logon to remote systems. You can create these exceptions to prevent false positives. This can be done for specific clients, systems or hosts.
