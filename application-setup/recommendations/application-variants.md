# Application Variants

Within several of the Protect4S Threat Detection applications (like for example the Use Case Selection and Use Case Policy) you can define so called application variants. These variants allow you to change the way the application is displayed. You can for example change the visible columms or the column width and save that to your own variant and set that variant as default for future use within that application. Protect44S Threat Detection has been shipped with Protect4S DEFAULT variants that offer a best practice display experience. If you want to use the Protect4S DEFAULT variant in a specific application, set this variant to the default by clicking the Manage button as displayed below:

After pressing the Manage button select the Default radio button for the Protect4S variant ans press Save:

The above is an application specific setting and must be repeated for individual application where needed.
