# S-000030-01

#### Description

This use case detects access to database tables that are marked as critical via SAP transactions.

#### Configuration

Transactional table access should be limited to a very few users that actually needs it, from a technology perspective (basisteam) or for business reasons. This includes a non-productive environment with replica data that might not be scrambled.

Policies can be used to define the users that are allowed to access this data and critical tables that should be monitored.

Use case S-000020-1, S-000040-1, S-000050-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
