# S-000100-01

#### Description

This use case detects changes to the system change options that can be set in transaction SE06.

#### Configuration

In general, a restricted group of e.g. basis consultants should be allowed to change this system setting. You can add these permitted users to the allow list to avoid false positives; should you wish to get notified regardless, you may as well just leave the policy empty. Policy 1007 can be used to define these permitted users to change the system settings. The policy is shared with S-000110-01 for the SCC4 changes.
