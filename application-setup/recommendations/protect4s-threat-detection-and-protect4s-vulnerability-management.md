# Protect4S Threat Detection and Protect4S Vulnerability Management

When using the combination of Protect4S Threat Detection and Protect4S Vulnerability Management the scanning of the Protect4S VM solution might trigger Threats in the Protect4S TD solution. This is hard to avoid since in order for the Protect4S VM solution to perform a deep and thorough analysis we make use for example of the Function Module RFC\_GET\_TABLE\_ENTRIES to retrieve specific data that can otherwise not be checked and is needed for a complete overview.&#x20;

To filter out these Threats you can create below exceptions in the policies for the user used in the Protect4S VM Solution (for example user PROTECT4S):
