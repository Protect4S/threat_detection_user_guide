description: High privilege users that logon from new hostname

# S-000190-01

#### Description

This use case detects the logon of users with high SAP privileges (e.g. SAP\_ALL profile users) from a hostname that is different as before. Be aware that a performance impact might occur when assigning large quantities of profiles to the policy of this use case. This use case is most complete when ABAP connections to all clients in the remote systems are created.

#### Configuration

Use this policy to define user profiles that should be monitored. When a user is assigned with one or more of the listed profiles, the host they connect from (as reflected in the field Terminal in the Security Audit Log) is monitored. This means that when these monitored users logon from a different host than the last known host, a threat is created in the Threat Detection solution. Additionally you can create exceptions for these values to prevent false positives. This can be done for example for specific clients, systems or hosts. If the user with the assigned profile is a shared account, you can define multiple hosts in the exception field or alternatively use a Group to define hosts to exclude.

Parameters can be used in the Use Case Selection to define after how many days a change in the hostname is no longer seen as a Threat. Think for example of scenario's when the difference between two events is more than 1 year, changes are high that specific user have gotten a new laptop and hostname. The default is set to more than or equal to 365 days:

Also you can specify the Authentication Type that should be taken into account. You can monitor logons via the SAPGui (Type A), via the Brower (type H), or both.
