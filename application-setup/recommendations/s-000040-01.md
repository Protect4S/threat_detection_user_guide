description: Downloading of critical database tables

# S-000040-01

#### Description

This use case detects downloading of data from database tables that are marked as critical according to the deny policy list.

#### Configuration

In general, some functional consultants or business users might need to download records from table(s) directly for analysis. This can also be someone from the audit department or a 3rd party reporting tool. Where the latter goes via RFC generally. While there might be a legitimate use for this access, you want to monitor access and downloading of critical database tables to establish at least a check mechanism that critical data is not downloaded unauthorized.

Policies can be used to define the critical tables that should be monitored and legitimate users that are allowed to download data from tables can be listed too.&#x20;

Use case S-000020-1, S-000030-1, S-000050-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa (because the authorization to download requires one to have access to the tables first which can be triggered either directly or via RFC).
