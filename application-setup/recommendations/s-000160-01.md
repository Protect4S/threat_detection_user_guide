# S-000160-01

#### Description

This use case detects activation of sensitive SAP Profile / Authorization(s).

#### Configuration

Other than the default SAP accounts, any user should not have any SAP delivered sensitive profiles assigned to their user.

In case many authorizations is required for a specific task, consider replicating the sensitive role for example sap\_all and remove any other authorization from that role. Debug authorization is one of the many examples that no consultants other than a developer have. This should normally only be done by a developer in any productive/business critical system.

Our solution is shipped with predefined policy rules for the SAP delivered profiles / authorizations.\
This can be maintained with policy 1000 and 2000.

Use case S-000150-01 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
