description: Critical database table access via Remote Function Call
---

# S-000020-01

#### Description

This use case detects access to database tables via Remote enabled Function Calls (RFC) that are marked as critical  according to the deny policy list.

#### Configuration

Policy 1001 and 2007 can be used to define the permitted users and critical tables that should be monitored. By default policy 1001 (_User(s) allowed to access ABAP tables_) is empty, you can provide here a list of users that are allowed to access the ABAP database tables mentioned in policy 2007. By default there are already many critical ABAP database tables provided, but you can add here specific ABAP tables.

In case that you use both the Protect4S Vulnerability Management solution and Protect4S Threat Detection Solution you might want to add the Protect4S RFC user to policy 1001 to prevent false positives as Protect4S VM might remotely read the USR02 table for example to check for backwards compatible password hashes.

Use case S-000030-1, S-000040-1, S-000050-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
