# S-000020-01

#### Description

This use case detects access to database tables that are marked as critical via Remote enabled Function Calls (RFC) according to the deny policy list. One can use this use case to monitor and review which sensitive tables defined in the policy is being accessed remotely.

#### Configuration

SAP Default accounts should **not** be in any RFC in any circumstances. If default account(s) is used during a client copy RFC should be removed once the activity is completed. Consult your SAP Basis team if you see any.

For each legitimate user used in RFCs that has the user type system or communication, include these in the allow list.

Policy 1001 and 2007 can be used to define the permitted users and critical tables that should be monitored.

Use case S-000030-1, S-000040-1, S-000050-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
