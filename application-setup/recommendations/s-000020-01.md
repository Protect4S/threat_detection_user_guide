# !S-000020-01

#### Description

This use case detects access to database tables that are marked as critical via Remote enabled Function Calls (RFC) according to the deny policy list. One can use the deny policy to detect&#x20;

#### Best practice

To minimize and avoid unwanted access to critical tables remotely, make sure to limit the number of users that has access has access to the sensitive tables, if you can't at least monitor them. And proceed with the hardening where needed.

Generally you would only want someone from the functional team to have access to some of the tables to perform their work. Although you will also have to make sure that one is not misusing their powers/privileges within the SAP system.\
Moderately monitoring any user permitted to execute certain task is also one way to go by not including that user in the allow list if they are generally not working frequently in the critical tables.

Use case S-000030-1 and S-000050-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.

#### Configuration

Policy 1001 and 2007 can be used to define the permitted users and critical tables that should be monitored.
