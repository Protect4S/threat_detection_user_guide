description: Critical database table access via Remote Function Call

# S-000020-01

#### Description

This use case detects access to database tables via Remote enabled Function Calls (RFC) that are marked as critical  according to the deny policy list.&#x20;

#### Configuration

Policy 1001 and 2007 can be used to define the permitted users and critical tables that should be monitored. By default policy 1001 (User(s) allowed to access ABAP tables) is empty, you can provide here a list of users that are allowed to access the ABAP database tables mentioned in policy 2007. By default there are already many critical ABAP database tables provided, but you can add here specific ABAP tables.

Use case S-000030-1, S-000040-1, S-000050-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
