#### Description

This use case detects debugging in critical systems.

#### Configuration

In general, only developers are allowed to debug, however; it is best not to allow debugging in other systems as development systems, especially in critical systems. This use case detects any debugging event on any systems linked with Threat Detection by default. Should you however wish to allow certain users for debugging you can do so by allowing a user with the policy 1002.

By leaving the policy list empty, the solution will monitor any of such event of any users on the monitored systems. As a general best practice to limit false positives you can copy the default policy 2002 and change the scope to the system role "Production" to only activate this use case for Productive systems.
