# S-000120-01

#### Description

This use case detects debugging in critical systems.

#### Configuration

In general only developers are allowed to debug, however; it is best not to allow debugging indefinitely in critical systems. Should you however wish to allow certain users for debugging you can do so by allowing a user with the policy 1002.

You may also leave the policy list empty; should you wish to get notified regardless if such event occur.
