description: Logon with SAP ABAP default accounts

# S-000150-01

#### Description

This use case detects logons to SAP ABAP systems with default accounts.

#### Configuration

In general default accounts should only be used by basis consultants during an emergency situation or installation/maintenance or to execute a specific task. Any default users should be monitored for logon.

Our solution is shipped with predefined policy rules for the default SAP accounts. Should you decide to add any other or remove any, it can be maintained in policy 2008.

Use case S-000160-01 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
