# S-000150-01

#### Description

This use case detects logons to SAP ABAP systems with default accounts.

#### Configuration

In general, SAP default accounts should not be used for daily operations. Occasionally only by basis consultants during an emergency situation or installation/maintenance or to execute a specific task like a client copy. Any default users should be monitored for logon.

Our solution is shipped with predefined policy rules for the default SAP accounts. Should you decide to add any other user or remove the default ones; it can be maintained in policy 2008.
