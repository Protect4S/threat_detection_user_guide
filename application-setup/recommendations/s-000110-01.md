# S-000110-01

#### Description

This use case detects changes to the client settings that can be set in transaction SCC4.

#### Configuration

In general, a restricted group of e.g. basis consultants should be allowed to change this system setting. You can add these permitted users to the allow list to avoid false positives; should you wish to get notified regardless, you may as well just leave the policy empty. Policies can be used to define these permitted users to change the system settings.&#x20;
