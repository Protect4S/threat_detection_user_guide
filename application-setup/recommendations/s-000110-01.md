# S-000110-01

#### Description

This use case detects changes to the client settings that can be set in transaction SCC4.\
To permit certain user(s) for this change, add these users to the allow policy list.

#### Configuration

In general only a basis consultant should be allowed to change this system setting as they understand the impact. Limit the authorizations to only basis consultant and add the permitted users to the allow list to avoid false positive; should you wish to get notified regardless you may as well just leave the policy empty.

Policy 1007 can be used to define the permitted users to change the system settings. The policy is shared with S-000100-01 for the SE06 changes.
