# Recommendations

This chapter covers best practices and tips and tricks to limit e.g. false positives. This chapter provides general information for each use case and will help you configure the parameters for each use case.

Note: As a rule of thumb from the security perspective: the less authorisations, the more secure.

Note: The process of finetuning is a constant one that is not finished after setup. You might need to return to the Allow / Deny policies periodically to further prevent false positives as user, configuration and parameters of SAP systems are sometimes dynamic.

Note: The suggestions given in these recommendation chapters are for someone with a security perspective background.&#x20;
