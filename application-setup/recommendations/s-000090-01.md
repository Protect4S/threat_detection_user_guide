# S-000090-01

#### Description

This use case detects successful Bruteforce or Password spray attempts on the ABAP application server within the given time window as defined in parameters of this use case. Leading to at least one successful login as part of all login attempts.

#### Configuration

Use this policy to define exceptions for threats that are created in case of Bruteforce attempts. Eventhough unlikely this might occur when performing specific testing from defined hosts. Keep in mind when using loadbalancers (e.g. Citrix) for end-user connections, this use case might be less relevant since all users connect from just one or a few hosts.

Parameters can be used in the Use Case Selection to define after how many attempts within how many seconds a Threat should be created. The default is set to more than or equal to 15 attempts in less than or equal to 300 seconds:
