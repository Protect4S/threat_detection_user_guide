# S-000050-01

#### Description

This use case detects the execution of remote critical Function Modules.

#### Configuration

Many technical and functional activities requires executing function modules. A business user in general however should not need to execute any of these in the foreground. Thus it should really be limited to only consultants/users who needs it for specific purposes.&#x20;

Policy 1010 and 2006 can be used to define the permitted users to execute function modules and to define the critical function modules that should be monitored.

In case that you use both the Protect4S Vulnerability Management solution and Protect4S Threat Detection Solution you might want to add the Protect4S RFC user to policy 1010 to prevent false positives as the Protect4S VM solution might use specific Function Modules to read some specific configuration or data.

For table specific, use case S-000020-1, S-000030-1, S-000040-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
