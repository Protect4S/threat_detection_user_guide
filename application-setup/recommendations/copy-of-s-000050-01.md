description: Downloading of critical database tables

# Copy of S-000050-01

#### Description

This use case detects downloading of data from database tables that are marked as critical according to the deny policy list.

#### Configuration

In general only a functional consultant would download records from table(s) directly for analysis, someone from the audit department or any 3rd party reporting tool. Thus the latter goes via RFC generally.

To monitor whom is downloading data from tables, policy 1001 and 2007 can be used to define the permitted users and critical tables that should be monitored.

Use case S-000020-1, S-000030-1, S-000040-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
