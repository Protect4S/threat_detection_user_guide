# S-000050-01

#### Description

This use case detects the execution of remote critical Function Modules listed in the deny policy list.

#### Configuration

Many technical and functional activities requires executing certain function modules. A generic user however should not need to execute any of these in the foreground. Thus it should really be limited to only consultants/users who needs it. You may use this use case to monitor but you can also use it to get an insight that will also aid you limiting the authorizations granted to your users.

Policy 1010 and 2006 can be used to define the permitted users and critical function modules that should be monitored.

For table specific, use case S-000020-1, S-000030-1, S-000040-1 and S-000070-1 strengthens this use case and vice-versa.
