Upon opening the Allow / Deny Policy application, the following screen shows up:

![Allow / Deny Polices list](<../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png>)

On the left hand side, we can see the attributes of the policy.\
Each attribute have their own importance depending on the policy it applies for.

On the right side of the screen, we can see that this policy is used in 3 different Use Cases, this means that adjusting this policy affect the 3 Use Cases.

In this tutorial, we would like to change a user in this allow policy list for User Administration.\


Below you can see that the current values are already defined for CUAADM and any user that starts with GRC because a wildcard is used at the end.

**Note:**\
****Awareness is critical here, a misconfiguration here means that certain threats might not get reported to SIEM.\
For example if you added a user to this allow list that should not be allowed to perform user administration. The system will then not report the threat to SIEM and will only see this as an event.
