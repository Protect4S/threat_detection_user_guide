# Configuring Policy Settings

â€‹The allow / deny policies are there to finetune the use cases and to prevent false positives.&#x20;

### Policy configuration

When opening the Allow / Deny Policy application, the following screen shows the available policies:

![Allow / Deny Polices list](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (31) (1).png>)

When selecting a specific policy you can see the details such as the scope they apply to, the use cases they are linked to and several other attributes of the policy (see [this page](./) for details).

### Adjusting the policy&#x20;

The allow / deny policies can be configured to better detect Threats in a SAP landscape. No SAP landscape is the same and customers have specific naming conventions for users, specific configurations and setup of the landscape. Via the policies you can finetune the details to limit false positives. After installation of Protect4S TD it is therefore important to tune the policies to reflect your specific situation. For each use case there are [recommendations](../recommendations/) for finetuning, find an example below:&#x20;

For use case S-000170-01 (User creation outside IAM\_CUA) a policy exists (1000 - User(s) allowed for user administration). This policy contains the usernames that are allowed to create users, e.g. via Central User Administration or IDM solutions. Often customers use a fixed name for these activities that is used also in RFC connections for example. This use case detects when users are created by users that are NOT on the Allow list. Below you can see an example where values are already defined for CUAADM and any user that starts with GRC because a wildcard is used at the end.

If you enter the policy in edit mode, you can change or add values of the policy, in our example, we have changed the value "CUAADM" to "CUAADMINISTRATOR". The values entered here will be converted to uppercase automatically.
