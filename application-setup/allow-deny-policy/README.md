# Use Case Policies

If you have been granted the security configurator role or the administrator role, you can access the Use Case Policy Fiori tile. Please visit [this](../system-configuration-fiori-application/users-and-authorizations/authorizations.md) page for more details regarding the authorizations.

In this application you can configure the use cases policies to a.o. minimise false positives.&#x20;

No SAP landscape is the same and use case policies often need tweaking and tuning in order to be the most effective, to limit false positives and add specific data for your situation. All fields are wildcard-enabled and you can use the hash symbol (#) to escape characters.

Use case policies are in many cases shipped with default best practices, but these can be extended with your own Threat values. For these Threat values you can then create exceptions for full flexibility and control over when to create a Threat and when not. In the next chapter, the available attributes are explained.
