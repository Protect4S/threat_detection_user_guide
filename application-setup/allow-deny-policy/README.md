# !Use Case Policies

If you have been granted the security configurator role or the administrator role, you can access the Use Case Policy Fiori Tile. Please visit [this](../system-configuration-fiori-application/users-and-authorizations/authorizations.md) page for more details regarding the authorizations.

You can use the Use Case Policy configuration to configure the policies per your requirement. You can also add additional Threat Values to monitor.

No SAP landscape is similar and use cases often need some tweaking and tuning in order to be effective, to limit false positives and add specific data for your situation. All fields are wildcard-enabled and you can use the SAP standard hash escape character (#), see note [574914](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/574914) & [2488648 ](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002488648)for details.

Anything added to the exception list will not be reported. Below overview lists the attributes for the use case policies:

| Threat value             | The Value that triggers the Use Case to send alert. For some use cases any value is considered a risk. Because the threat value is unknow this field won't be shown. E.g. you cannot tell upfront whom will be debugging in your system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Risk                     | If the Use Case is Risk Enabled, this field gets displayed and you can define for each Threat a risk.

| Client Exception         | Define a SAP system client for a threat value exempted for a systems/system role/system group or specific single system.

| Client Exception Group   | A group of clients defined in the Group application, this can be used to exclude a threat value for multiple clients at once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Example of wildcard usage

Wildcards can be used for every exceptions. For Hosts however, it can get complicated. we have listed a few examples of wildcards that can be used for hosts exception.

The table is formatted as the following: First column is the explanatory of the wildcard value entered mentioned in 2nd column labeled as Exception values. The third column labeled as Expected exceptions is what you can expect the exception value will exclude from alerting.
