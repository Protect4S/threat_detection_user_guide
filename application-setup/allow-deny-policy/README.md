# Use Case Policies

If you have been granted the security configurator role or the administrator role, you can access the Use Case Policy Fiori tile. Please visit [this](../system-configuration-fiori-application/users-and-authorizations/authorizations.md) page for more details regarding the authorizations.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use Case Policy Configuration</p></figcaption></figure>

In this application you can configure use cases for example to minimise false positives.&#x20;

No SAP landscape is the same and use cases often need some tweaking and tuning in order to be effective, to limit false positives and add specific data for your situation. All fields are wildcard-enabled and you can use the hash symbol (#) to escape characters. See note [574914](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/574914) & [2488648 ](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002488648)for details. For example if you want to use the specific value "SAP\*" to address the emergency user in a policy you can use the value "SAP#\*".

If you add values to the exception list, then no Threat will be created. Below overview lists the attributes for the use case policies:

### **Attribute legend:**

Below is a list of attributes that is shown for each Use Case Policy.

| Active                   | Use this option to activate or deactivate Threat values. The Threat Values we have pre-defined cannot be removed. You can use this option to deactivate instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Threat value             | The Value that triggers the Use Case to send alert. For some use cases any value is considered a risk. Because the threat value is unknow this field won't be shown. E.g. you cannot tell upfront whom will be debugging in your system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Risk                     | If the Use Case is Risk Enabled, this field gets displayed and you can define for each Threat a risk.

| Client Exception         | Define a SAP system client for a threat value exempted for a systems/system role/system group or specific single system.

| Client Exception Group   | A group of clients defined in the Group application, this can be used to exclude a threat value for multiple clients at once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| System                   | Define a system for a threat exempted for systems/system role/system group or a specific single system You can enter here the SAP SID or you can enter the TD system number with bracket. The value here are single values and can be comma separated to exempt multiple clients in one line.                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Host Exception           | Define a host/terminal for a threat exempted for systems/system role/system group or a specific single system. The value here can be either hostname, FQDN or ip address. The exempted host must correspond to what is shown in the audit log or gateway log. Wildcard can be used to define multiple hostnames. IP range however cannot be defined with hyphen. The value here are single values and can be comma separated to exempt multiple clients in one line. |

#### Example of wildcard usage

Wildcards can be used for exceptions. For _**Hosts**_ we have listed a few examples of wildcards that can be used for host exceptions.

The table is formatted like this: The first column is the explanation of the wildcard value that you enter in the 2nd column (labeled as Exception values). The third column is how the TD application processes or sees these values. These are the values that are excluded preventing the creation of Threats.&#x20;
