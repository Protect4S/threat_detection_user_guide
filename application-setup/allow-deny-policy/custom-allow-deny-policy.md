# Custom Allow / Deny Policy

You can copy allow deny policies to your own version and assign this particular allow deny policy to just 1 system or whole landscape.

Notice if you choose to assign the Allow / Deny Policy to just one system whilst you have created more than 1 system to the same system in the Threat Detection Solution you will have to create another additional custom allow / deny policy and adapt the values where needed in the policy should you wish to adapt the same values, you may just create a copy of the custom policy you created. Do notice that they will have to be adjusted individually should there a need of change.



**To copy a policy.**
