The Use Case Selection application allows you to define what usecases you want to activate for which systems. It is possible that in specific cases you do not need or want specific use cases to be active for a specific system. You may switch the Use Cases On or Off by clicking on "Set Inactive" to deactivate or "Set active" to Activate them. By default all Use Cases will be activated upon adding the system in Threat Detection solution. To get details about specific Use Cases, you can go to the Use Case Information application. More information regarding this application can be found [here](../support/use-case-information.md).

### Using the Use Case Selection

Upon opening this Fiori application, you will get a screen like below:

![Use Case Selection overview](<../.gitbook/assets/image (76).png>)

This is a list of all the Use Cases there are currently in the system for the connected Systems. On the left you see a coloured Bar. <mark style="color:green;">**Green**</mark> means that the Use Case is active for that particular system, <mark style="color:red;">**Red**</mark> means it is not active for that system.

By clicking on a specific line you can see details about the use case and the System it belongs to:&#x20;

On the top right you can set the Use Case to Inactive to disable the use case so that this won't be checked for this particular system or switch it back on if you wish to do so.
