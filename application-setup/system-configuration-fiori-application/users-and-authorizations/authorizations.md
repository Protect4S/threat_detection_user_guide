# Roles - Overview

Once the Protect4S Threat Detection solution has been installed, the central system will have several roles available. Before proceeding with the configuration of the solution, make sure to have the proper roles assigned to the respective team members.

Below is an overview of roles with a description that can be used to assign the required authorization per user type.
