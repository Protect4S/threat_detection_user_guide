# Using HTTPS for SAPControl





![SAPControl setup](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)

During the creation of the system, you can choose to use https for the sapcontrol connection (step 4). By configuring the sapcontrol connections this way, the following requirements must be met.

#### Requirements

* HTTPS service active in SMICM on the system where TD is installed (permanently created via profile, not just dynamically activated in SMICM as it will be removed after a restart)
* PSE keystore ‘SSL client SSL Client (Anonymous)’  is activated in transaction STRUST
* HTTPS port is enabled of port 5<##>14 on the satellite systems
* Satellite OS certificates will have to be imported into the Anonymous PSE keystore on the system where Protect4S Threat Detection solution is installed.

#### Getting the certificate&#x20;

Certificate can be saved via a browser on a system that can reach this satellite system by navigating to the URL https://\<satellite hostname>:5<##>14 where ## is the instance number.
