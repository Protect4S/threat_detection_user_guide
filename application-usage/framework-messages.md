# Framework Messages

The Framework Messages application provides insight in errors and messages that are collected during the operation of the Protect4S TD solution. This can be errors or messages in the area of connections to the monitored SAP systems, the read framework, the connection to SIEM, etc, etc. The Framework Messages application can be started via the tile on the Fiori Launchpad:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png>)

The application provides an overview of all stored Messages and the details of those Messages:

This application helps troubleshoot issues. These Messages are only stored for a fixed number of days in the Central Protect4S TD solution, depending on the parameters in the Application Settings.
