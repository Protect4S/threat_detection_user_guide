# Threats

The Threats application provides insight in Threats generated by the Protect4S Thread Detection solution. It can be started via the Threats tile on the Fiori Launchpad:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

The application provides an overview of all generated Threats and the details of those Threats.&#x20;

![Threat, related event and event details](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

This application helps to see what Threats are generated. In most scenario's these Threats are forwarded to a SIEM solution and from there processed (via e.g. an incident or otherwise). The Threat application on the Central Protect4S system is there for reference purposes.
