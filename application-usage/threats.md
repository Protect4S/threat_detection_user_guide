# Threats

The Threats application provides insight in threats generated by the Protect4S Threat Detection solution. It can be started via the Threats tile on the Fiori Launchpad:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38) (1).png>)

The application provides an overview of all generated threats and the details of those threats.

![Threat, related event and event details](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1).png>)

This application helps to analyse what threats are generated. In most scenario's these threats are forwarded to a SIEM solution and processed there (via e.g. an incident or otherwise). The Threat application on the Central Protect4S system is there for reference purposes. The threats are only stored for several days (180 by default) in the Central Protect4S TD solution, depending on the parameters in the Application Settings.

Information regarding these parameters is explained [here](../application-setup/application-settings.md).
