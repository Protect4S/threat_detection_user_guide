# Events

The Events application provides insight in events that are collected from the monitored SAP systems. The events stored on the Protect4S Central TD system are only those events that are needed for the currently implemented use cases. Not all events activated on the monitored SAP systems are collected and stored in the central Protect4S TD system. The Events application can be started via the Events tile on the Fiori Launchpad:

The application provides an overview of all centrally stored events and the details of those events:

This application helps to see what events are collected. These events are used for threat intelligence and to decide if a threat has occurred or not. These events are only stored for several hours in the Central Protect4S TD solution, depending on the parameters in the Application Settings. Information regarding this parameter is explained [here](../application-setup/application-settings.md).
